Langregate

Langregate is a web app targeted at language learners who want to discover new forms of media in their target language. Users are able
to create an account, save movies, tv series, and articles as well as vocabulary which can be extracted from various sections of the aforementioned
types of media. The frontend of the web app runs on React and on the backend I have used Express, MongoDB, JWT Tokens and of course
various api technologies. The movie and series data comes from TMDB Api and all of the articles are collected using Newscatcher.
